								<p>
									I am an aspiring Tools Programmer, having graduated from DigiPen Institute of Technology in April 2024 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer
									Science. My passion lies in building efficient game engine tools that will aid in the development of fun and engaging games.
								</p>
								<p>
									During my time at DigiPen, I have been involved in many team projects. I also worked on several personal projects alongside them.
									Check them out <a href="#projects">here</a>.

								<h3><div id="OMG">Online Multiplayer Game (01/2024 - 04/2024)</div></h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/OMG.PNG" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										<b>Project</b>: 3D Multiplayer First Person Shooter <br/>
										<b>Engine</b>: Unreal Engine 5.3 (Blueprints) <br/>
										<b>Role(s)</b>: Weapons and Tools Programmer <br/>
										<b>Features Implemented</b>: Weapon System, Health System, Player Death Functionality <br/>
										<b>Team Size</b>: 4
									</p>
									<p>
										My focus with this project was to build a weapon system that was robust, expandable, and modular. As such, I approached the
										development of the system with generalization in mind, aiming for ease of use and/or modification by designers and programmers alike.
										As a result the team was able to iterate quickly after every playtest and widen our scope for the final product. Additionally, while
										working closely with the networking programmer, I managed to pick up replication techniques in blueprints.
									</p>
									<p>
										This project is still in progress, therefore there is no release link.
									</p>
								<h3><div id="TheDrawerWar">The Drawer War (08/2024 - 12/2024)</div></h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/DrawerWar.PNG" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										<b>Project</b>: Tech Demo / Research Project <br/>
										<b>Engine</b>: Unity (C#) <br/>
										<b>Role(s)</b>: Framework and AI Programmer <br/>
										<b>Features Implemented</b>: AI Framework <br/>
										<b>Team Size</b>: 2
									</p>
									<p>
										What was originally meant to be a 2D bullet hell game featuring AI movement behaviors and physics simulations quickly pivoted into a
										tech demo / research project about Unity's ECS package. Our focus then shifted to implementing a few AI behaviors and a collision engine,
										optimizing these features for performance. The AI framework I developed takes advantage of abstraction to modularize the different
										enemies and behaviors, while simultaneously reaping the full benefits of the data oriented nature of the ECS system. This resulted in a
										system twice as fast as MonoBehaviors.

								<h3><div id="PCG">Perlin Noise Procedural Generation (12/2024)</div></h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/PCG.PNG" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										<b>Project</b>: Tech Demo / Research Project <br/>
										<b>Engine</b>: Unity (C#) <br/>
										<b>Role(s)</b>: Framework Programmer <br/>
										<b>Features Implemented</b>: Grid Framework <br/>
										<b>Team Size</b>: 3
									</p>
									<p>
										During an AI class I took at Digipen, our final project was a simple tech demo of a chosen topic. Myself and a team of two others decided
										on Perlin Nouse and Procedural Generation. Given only a week to complete the demo, we focused on a simple medium of 2D tiles with corners
										that could either represent land (green) or water (blue). My focus was on creating a Grid struct and designing and implementing a simple
										framework that would connect the tile assets to the Perlin Noise generator, resulting in a procedurally generated 2D terrain.
									</p>
								<h3><div id="InfeStation">InfeStation (08/2022 - 12/2023)</div></h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Infestation.PNG" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										<b>Project</b>: 3D Space Themed Horror First Person Shooter <br/>
										<b>Engine</b>: Unreal Engine 5.0 (Blueprints) <br/>
										<b>Role(s)</b>: AI and Animations Programmer <br/>
										<b>Features Implemented</b>: AI Framework, Main Enemy, Player & Enemy Animations <br/>
										<b>Team Size</b>: 8
									</p>
									<p>
										My interest in artificial intelligence motivated me to focus on developing AI behaviors using UE5's behavior trees. It was my first time
										working with blueprints and behavior trees and as such, I had insurmountable hurdles to overcome. The steep learning curve of UE's
										blueprint workflow and the sophisticated nature of the built in AI framework in particular, proved to be challenging. However, by
										prioritizing sandboxing and learning the ins and outs of the tasks I would implement, I quickly learned how to work efficiently in this
										new environment. The end result was an organized system that made it easy to add and remove enemy behaviors as well as iterate on
										existing features.
									</p>
									<p>
										Note that the version of this game that I last worked on is not the latest. When the team decided to pursue a third semester of work for
										polish, I decided to leave the team in favor of starting a new project (<a href="#TheDrawerWar">TheDrawerWar</a>). The AI programmer who
										took over my position continued to work on the enemy in the new release. Both releases are included below.
									</p>
									<p>
										Find the <a href="https://shorturl.at/mDHPR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">old release</a> and the
										<a href="https://shorturl.at/pFMSV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new release</a> here.
									</p>
								<h3>Rekindled Flame (08/2021 - 04/2022)</h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/RekindledFlame.PNG" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										<b>Project</b>: 2D Horror Platformer <br/>
										<b>Engine</b>: Custom Engine (C++) <br/>
										<b>Role(s)</b>: Physics & Collisions Programmer, Player Behaviors Programmer, Support Programmer <br/>
										<b>Features Implemented</b>: Physics System, Player Movement Behaviors, Custom Imgui Editor <br/>
										<b>Team Size</b>: 11
									</p>
									<p>
										This was the project that ignited my passion for game tools development. Building a custom 2D engine was incredibly fun just as it was
										challenging. During the early stages of the engines development, I was tasked with building the physics and collision systems. Later on
										I acted as a support programmer, assisting other team members with higher priority tasks in order to increase the team's overall
										productivity. As a support programmer I implemented player behavior features, a particle system, and helped implement an in-game custom
										level editor using imgui. The development of the editor was the highlight of this project for me. Building systems capable of
										encapsulating the complexities of the underlying feature as well as simplifing the work done by potential users of the system was what
										made me realize my passion for developing tools.

								<h2 class="major">Personal Projects</h2>
								<h3><div id="CustomEngine">2D Custom Game Engine</div></h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/2DCustomEngine.PNG" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										<b>Language</b>: C++
									</p>
									<p>
										This personal project is mainly a sandbox for me to experiment and develop tools and systems that work efficiently together. Once the
										engine has most of its core features implemented, I plan to develop and publish 2D games using it. The engine is currently in its early
										stages of development.
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>Features</b>: 2D Collision System, 2D OpenGL Renderer, ECS System, JSON (de)serialization.
									</p>
								<h3>Templated Math Library</h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/math.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										<b>Language</b>: C++
									</p>
									<p>
										While taking some math classes at DigiPen I decided to build a math library that would be filled with useful math functions. As I
										learned more in my classes, I added more functionality to this library. This library will continue to grow as my knowledge expands.
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>Features</b>: Vector, matrix, polynomial arithmetic and operations.
									</p>
								<h3>Tic-Tac-Toe w/ Minimax</h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/TicTacToe.PNG" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										<b>Language</b>: Java
									</p>
									<p>
										While learning programming for the first time in Python, I programmed a console tic-tac-toe game. Being the most challenging task at the
										time, I wanted to eventually improve on it. So, a few years of programming experience later, I decided to recreate my tic-tac-toe
										program in Java, the language I was learning at the time. I settled on adding a GUI using Java swing, and implementing some kind of AI.
										After some research, I decided to implement minimax since it was conceptually simple to code but also complex enough in its behavior.

								<p>
									Hello! My name is Mahin Arjhuna Goban and I am a Tools Programmer. I am a 24 year old Malaysian. I have been playing video games from a
									young age, and my love for video games grew as I did. Some of the games which defined my childhood and teenage years were League of Legends,
									Osu, and Overwatch. I have been playing League of Legends and Osu for over 10 years, and I have competed in Osu regional tournaments for 5
									years (2015-2018, 2022). I made it quite far up the global and national ladder, achieving a peak rank of 7K / 5M globally, and 30 / 10K in
									Malaysia.
								</p>
								<p>
									I play sports, in particular soccer and badminton. I enjoyed soccer so much that I joined the official DigiPen soccer team and participated
									in local competitions. I also like indoor climbing from time to time.
								</p>
								<p>
									Music has always been an important part of my life. I learned the drums when I was 10 years old, then moved onto the guitar. I currently
									enjoy creating tracks on FL Studio and uploading some of them to soundcloud. I use soundcloud as a sort of playground for me to experiment
									with music creation and keep track of my progress. Osu, which is incidentally a music rhythm game, is the game I excel at. What I love most
									most about Osu is the fact that it provides a means to visualize an auditory experience. When done well it can be an absolutely amazing
									experience.
								</p>
								<p>
									As a programmer I love tackling challenging problems using creative ideas. I also really enjoy the abstraction of higher level concepts,
									building structured frameworks, and modularizing code. As such, my goal of becoming a tools developer is fitting.
								</p>
								<p>
									As a person I value good friends and enjoy deep conversations. I also care about making meaningful connections and spending time with the
									people I care about.
								</p>
