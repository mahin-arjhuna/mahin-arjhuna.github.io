									I am a Senior at <a href="https://www.digipen.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DigiPen Institute of Technology</a>
									, graduating in April 2024 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My passion lies in building efficient game engine tools
									that will aid in the development of fun and engaging games.
								</p>
								<p>
									During my time at DigiPen, I have been involved in many team projects. I also worked on several personal projects alongside them.

								<h3>Online Multiplayer Game (01/2024 - 04/2024)</h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/OMG.PNG" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										<b>Project</b>: 3D Multiplayer First Person Shooter <br/>
										<b>Engine</b>: Unreal Engine 5.3 (Blueprints) <br/>
										<b>Role(s)</b>: Combat Programmer <br/>
										<b>Features Implemented</b>: Weapon System, Health System, Player Death Functionality <br/>
										<b>Team Size</b>: 4
									</p>
									<p>
										My focus with this project was to build a weapon system that was robust, expandable, and modular. As such, I approached the
										development of the system with generalization in mind, aiming to be easy to use and/or modify by designers and programmers alike. The
										benefit of this system was that the team was able to iterate quickly after every playtest, and as a result, widen our scope for the
										final product.

								<h3><div id="TheDrawerWar">The Drawer War (08/2024 - 12/2024)</div></h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/DrawerWar.PNG" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										<b>Project</b>: Tech Demo / Research Project <br/>
										<b>Engine</b>: Unity (C#) <br/>
										<b>Role(s)</b>: Systems Designer and AI Programmer <br/>
										<b>Features Implemented</b>: AI Framework <br/>
										<b>Team Size</b>: 2
									</p>
									<p>
										What originally was meant to be a 2D bullet hell game featuring AI behaviors and physics simulations quickly pivoted into a tech demo
										/ research project about Unity's ECS package. The tech demo still features several AI behaviors and a collision engine, but the focus
										was optimizing these features for performance. The AI framework I developed takes advantage of abstraction to modularize the different
										enemies and behaviors, while simultaneously reaping the full benefits of the data oriented nature of the ECS system. The result was a
										system that performs twice as fast as MonoBehaviors.

								<h3>InfeStation (08/2022 - 12/2023)</h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Infestation.PNG" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										<b>Project</b>: 3D Space Themed Horror First Person Shooter <br/>
										<b>Engine</b>: Unreal Engine 5.0 (Blueprints) <br/>
										<b>Role(s)</b>: AI Programmer & Animations Programmer <br/>
										<b>Features Implemented</b>: AI Framework, Main Enemy, Player & Enemy Animations <br/>
										<b>Team Size</b>: 8
									</p>
									<p>
										At the start of this project I had an interest in AI, so I decided to focus on developing AI behavior using UE5's behavior trees. Being
										my first time working with blueprints and behavior trees, I had insurmountable hurdles to overcome. In particular, the steep learning
										curve of UE's blueprint workflow and the sophisticated nature of the built in AI framework proved to be challenging. However, by
										prioritizing sandboxing and learning the ins and outs of the tasks I would implement I quickly learned how to work efficiently in this
										new environment. The end result was an organized system that made it easy to add and remove enemy behaviors as well as iterate on
										existing features.
									</p>
									<p>
										Note that the version of this game that I lasted work on is not the latest version of the game. When the team decided to pursue a third
										semester of work for polish, I decided to leave the team in favor of starting a new project (<a href="#TheDrawerWar">TheDrawerWar</a>).
										The AI programmer that took over my position continued to work on the enemy in the new release. Both releases are included below.
									</p>
									<p>
										Find the <a href="https://shorturl.at/mDHPR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">old release</a> and the
										<a href="https://shorturl.at/pFMSV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new release</a> here.

								<h3>Rekindled Flame (08/2021 - 04/2022)</h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/RekindledFlame.PNG" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										<b>Project</b>: 2D Horror Platformer <br/>
										<b>Engine</b>: Custom Engine (C++) <br/>
										<b>Role(s)</b>: Physics & Collisions Programmer, Player Behaviors Programmer, Support Programmer <br/>
										<b>Features Implemented</b>: Physics System, Player Movement Behaviors, Custom Imgui Editor <br/>
										<b>Team Size</b>: 11
									</p>
									<p>
										This was the project that birthed my passion for game tools development. Building a custom 2D engine was incredibly fun just as it was
										challenging. During the early stages of the engines development I was tasked with building the physics and collision systems. Later on
										I acted as a support programmer, assisting other team members with higher priority tasks in order to increase the team's overall
										productivity. As a support programmer I implemented player behavior features, a particle system, and helped implement an in-game custom
										level editor using imgui. The development of the editor was my personal highlight of this project. Building systems that both encapsulate
										the complexities of the underlying feature as well as simplify the work done by designers was what made me realize my passion for
										developing game tools.

								<h3>2D Custom Game Engine</h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/2DCustomEngine.PNG" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										This personal project is mainly a sandbox for me to experiment and develop tools and systems that work efficiently together. Once the
										engine has most of its core features implemented I plan to develop and publish 2D games using it. The engine is currently still in its
										early development stages.
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>Features</b>: 2D Collision System, 2D OpenGL Renderer, ECS System, JSON (de)serialization, Built in Player Control Templates.
									</p>
								<h3>Templated Math Library</h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/math.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										While taking some math classes at DigiPen I decided to build a math library that would be filled with useful math functions. As I
										learned more in my classes, I added more functionality to this library. This library will continue to grow as my knowledge expands.
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>Features</b>: Vector, matrix, polynomial arithmetic and operations.

								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Me.PNG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									Hello! My name is Mahin Arjhuna Goban and I am a game tools programmer. I am 24 years old and I come from Malaysia. Ever since I was young I
									have been playing video games, and so my love for video games grew as I did. Some of the games that highlighted my childhood and teenage years
									were League of Legends, Osu, and Overwatch. In particular, I have been playing League of Legends and Osu for over 10 years.
								</p>
								<p>
									I enjoy playing sports like badminton and soccer, but after coming to US I started focusing more on soccer. I also enjoy indoor climbing from
									time to time.
								</p>
								<p>
									Music has always been a big part of my life. As such, I learned the drums when I was younger, then moved onto the guitar. I currently enjoy
									making tracks on FL Studio, and as mentioned before I still play Osu, a music rhythm game. Osu is currently the game I am best at. I made it
									quite far up the global and national ladder and I have also taken part in tournaments in the past.
								</p>
								<p>
									As a programmer, I enjoy tackling challenging problems using creative ideas. I also really enjoy the abstraction of higher level concepts,
									building structured frameworks, and modularizing code. As such, my goal of becoming a game engine tools developer is fitting.
								</p>
